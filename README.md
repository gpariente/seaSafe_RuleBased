# seaSafe Simulator ðŸš¢

SeaSafe is a maritime collision avoidance simulator designed to test and validate a rule-based algorithm for ship navigation in compliance with the **International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs)**.
The simulator enables users to configure and run scenarios involving multiple ships, observing how they navigate and avoid collisions dynamically.

SeaSafe supports:

- **Two-ship and multi-ship collision scenarios**
- **Manual and automatic scenario creation**
- **Real-time simulation with visualization**
- **Logging and statistical analysis of simulation results**
